## Intent
At the turn of the century, just 25 years ago, biological experiments were extremely labor intensive and produced small amounts of data. Today, technological developments have made it common for a single biological experiment to generate millions of data points.  Computational methods are essential to analyze and interpret these massive datasets. In this course, you will learn the basic skills necessary to conduct biological research using computers.

## Objectives

### After completing this course you will be able to:
* Connect to a high performance compute cluster
* Use basic command line skills to navigate directories, create and manipulate files, and to execute programs
* Iterate processes using for loops
* Keep a computational laboratory notebook using Markdown
* Manage a reproducible computational project using GitHub
* Conduct analysis of biological datasets and visualization of results using the statistical computing software R and the RStudio interface

### In addition to developing basic computational skills, you will conduct biological research that will most of the following:
* Assemble a new genome
* Identify the sequences within the genome with particular biological function
* Align sequences to a genome and identify genetic differences between individuals
* Align entire genomes to one another and identify large scale changes
* Link genomic differences to changes in phenotype using genome-wide association studies
* Identify changes in gene expression between samples using transcriptomic datasets
