## Intent
At the turn of the century, just 25 years ago, biological experiments were extremely labor intensive and produced small amounts of data. Today, technological developments have made it common for a single biological experiment to generate millions of data points.  Computational methods are essential to analyze and interpret these massive datasets. In this course, you will learn the basic skills necessary to conduct biological research using computers.

## Objectives

### After completing this course you will be able to:
* Connect to a high performance compute cluster
* Use basic command line skills to navigate directories, create and manipulate files, and to execute programs
* Iterate processes using for loops
* Keep a computational laboratory notebook using Markdown
* Manage a reproducible computational project using GitHub
* Conduct analysis of biological datasets and visualization of results using the statistical computing software R and the RStudio interface

### In addition to developing basic computational skills, you will conduct biological research that will most of the following:
* Assemble a new genome
* Identify the sequences within the genome with particular biological function
* Align sequences to a genome and identify genetic differences between individuals
* Align entire genomes to one another and identify large scale changes
* Link genomic differences to changes in phenotype using genome-wide association studies
* Identify changes in gene expression between samples using transcriptomic datasets
## Required Course Materials
There are two main text books for this course. The first is **Bioinformatics Data Skills** by Vince Buffalo. You should have access to this text via the University of California site license for O'Reilly books [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/). Log-in using your campus credentials and you should have access at least while on campus, but you may need to setup a campus VPN through the library to get access off campus. You can find cheap used versions of this text online as well.
The second text that we may also use as a reference is Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's R for Science which you can find [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

### Technology Requirements
Because this course is a computational lab, you will need the following:

#### Hardware
Access to a current Mac or PC laptop.

#### Software
Up to data versions of either Windows or OS.

#### Internet Connection
You will need a reliable internet connection. Test your internet speed using speedtest.net Links to an external site.. Recommended internet speeds:

Ping response is less than 100ms
Download speed is at least 10Mbps
Upload speed is at least 2Mbps

**If you do not have or cannot acquire these items, you can apply to the Loan2Learn program to get a loaner device. Please contact either myself or the teaching assistant of any difficulty or delay in acquiring these devices.**

For technology support, contact Bearhelp@ucr.edu.

## Grading
Grades will be assigned according to the following scheme. For lecture exams where the median grade of the class falls below 75, a curve will be applied to adjust all scores to this median.

Your grade will be calulated from the following:
* Lab exercises  45%
* Quizzes 10%
* Participation 5%
* Lab Project 40%

|Grade|Range|
|-----|-----|
|A|>92.5|
|A-|90 - 92.5|
|B+|87.5 - 90|
|B|82.5 - 87.5|
|B-|80 - 82.5|
|C+|77.5 - 80|
|C|72.5 - 77.5|
|C-|70 - 72.5|
|D+|67.5 - 70|
|D|62.5 - 67.5|
|D-|60 - 62.5|
|F|<60|

### Regrading Policies
All re-grading requests for exams, quizzes, and assignments must be submitted in writing with an explanation for why the scoring is thought to be inaccurate.

### Lab Attendance
This course is built around a computational lab that provides you the opputunity to interact with the instructor and each other while trying to work through bioinformatics workflows. Because I believe this interaction to be core to the development of new computational skills,  attendance of the lab as part of your participation grade. If you have an emergency that requires you to miss lab, please inform the instructor as soon as possible

## UCR ACADEMIC POLICIES AND STUDENT SUPPORT
### ITS Help and Student Technology Support
ITS Student Technology Services supports 9 student computer labs, including 7 public labs and 2 nonpublic labs, with approximately 293 public lab hours per week (with reduced hours during breaks and summer) available for academic use by all UCR students.

 Whether you need a machine to work on your paper, need to use specialized software required by your class, assistance with your R'Mail or iLearn accounts, getting on the network, or any other services used by UCR students, contact Bearhelp@ucr.edu.

### Academic Misconduct
In addition to the course conduct policies outlined by your professor in the Course Syllabus in the online classroom, please review the Graduate Student Handbook. 

It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with the definitions, policies, and procedures concerning academic misconduct. Please revisit our Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures for more information. This site also defines misconduct, provides examples of prohibited conduct, and explains the sanctions available for those found guilty of misconduct.

### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the most common form of academic misconduct at UCR. It is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. This includes the copying of language, structure, or ideas of another and attributing (explicitly or implicitly) the work to one's own efforts. Plagiarism means using another's work without giving credit.

For more information about plagiarism, see Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures.

### Reasonable Accommodation for Disabilities
UCR is committed to providing reasonable accommodation for all students with disabilities. Students with disabilities who require accommodations in this course should contact their professor as early in the semester as possible.

Students with disabilities must be registered with the Student Disability Resource Center prior to receiving accommodations in this course.

If you have a disability and you would like to make a request for reasonable accommodation, please see the Graduate Student Handbook or get in touch with the Student Disability Resource Center.

### Adjustments for Pregnancy/Childbirth Related Issues
Should you need modifications or adjustments to your course requirements because of documented pregnancy-related or childbirth-related issues, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss your options. Generally, modifications will be made where medically necessary and similar in scope to accommodations based on temporary disability.  Learn more about the rights of pregnant and parenting students by consulting the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

### Title IX Resources
For any concerns regarding gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, stalking, or intimate partner violence, the University offers a variety of resources, including advocates on-call 24/7, counseling services, mutual no contact orders, scheduling adjustments, and disciplinary sanctions against the perpetrator. Please see the Title IX website for more information. They can be reached at (951)827-7070. You can also file a report.

### Student Needs
Student Health Services, Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS), Residential Life, Dining, and Râ€™Pantry are available to support students. 

### Religious Holidays
It is the policy of the University to excuse absences of students that result from religious observances and to provide for the rescheduling of examinations and additional required classwork that may fall on religious holidays without penalty. It is the responsibility of the student to make alternate arrangements with the instructor at least one week prior to the actual date of the religious holiday.

### Copyright Policy
It is illegal to download, upload, reproduce, or distribute any copyrighted material, in any form and in any fashion, without permission from the copyright holder or his/her authorized agent. UCR expects all members of its community to comply fully with federal copyright laws.

### Registration and Withdrawal
If you choose to withdraw from this course, you must complete the appropriate University form and turn the form in before the deadline. Deadlines are shown in the Academic Calendar, which is available from the Office of the Registrar.
