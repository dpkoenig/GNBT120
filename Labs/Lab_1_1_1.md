# Connecting to RStudio and turning in projects
## Overview
We will use git to turn in assignments. I will post a link for each assignment. The link will ask you to logon to GitHub and join the GNBT 120 classroom.

For each assignment click on the link and follow instructions below to create your own repository for the assignment.

Remember to use Rstudio or the command line to git add files that you create or change, git commit your changes and git push. DO THIS VERY OFTEN! That way if something goes wrong you wonâ€™t have lost any work.

Make your final pushes before the assignment due date.

You can check your repo on GitHub.com to make sure that your latest changes have been uploaded.

Projects in RStudio
Rstudio allows you to work in projects to help you keep your files organized. Furthermore it allows these projects to be associated with a github repository. This is how we will work on each assignment in this class. Below I show you how to create an Rstudio project for Assignment 01 by creating and cloning your Assignment 01 repo.
